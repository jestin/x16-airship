# Unnamed Commander X16 Airship Game

I've been developing some tools (links to come) for creating graphics for the
Commander X16 using a modern desktop computer.  To test these tools, it's best
to actually use them for developing a game.  This is that game, or at least it
will be.  Because my daughters liked to pretend our house was an airship during
2020, that's the theme I'm going with.  Details are...vague, but I suspect it
will be an RPG utilizing different graphic modes of the VERA chip.  That way I
can test out my tools.
